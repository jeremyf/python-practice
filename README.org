The purpose of this repository is for me to have a place where I’m practicing Python.

I added the following to [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs][my Emacs configuration]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package python
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :hook (python-mode . jf/python-mode-configurator)
    :config
    (defun jf/python-mode-configurator ()
      (eldoc-mode t)
      (python-docstring-mode t)
      (setq-default python-indent-offset 4)
      ;; I’m loving an 80 column fill…Why?  Because on my small computer I can
      ;; have 4 windows laid out in a quadrant and see all of the code/text.
      (setq-local fill-column 80)))

  ;; The treesit package of Emacs 29+ behaves a bit different.
  (add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'jf/python-mode-configurator)

  ;; A Python syntax validator/linter.
  (use-package flymake-ruff
    :straight t
    :hook (eglot-managed-mode . flymake-ruff-load))

  ;; To provide some syntax highlighting of docstrings, and more.
  (use-package python-docstring
    :straight t)

  ;; To create narrowable groups
  (dolist (python '(python-mode python-ts-mode))
  (add-to-list 'consult-imenu-config
    `(,python
       :toplevel "Method"
       :types ((?f "Field" font-lock-variable-name-face)
                (?c "Class" font-lock-type-face)
                (?m "Method" font-lock-function-name-face)
                (?v "Variable" font-lock-variable-name-face)
                ))))
#+end_src

I started reading [[https://python-patterns.guide/][Brandon Rhodes’ Python Patterns]]; a dear friend with whom I have dinner and beers every Thursday evening.

With =python-mode= enabled, I typed =C-c C-c= and Emacs prompted me to start a Python process by typing =C-c C-p=.  I started the process, and went back to my Python code, then typed =C-c C-c= and the print statements were echoed to that Python process.  Super helpful for introspection.
